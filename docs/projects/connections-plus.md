s# Connections Plus - Portfolio Project

A sophisticated daily word puzzle game that reimagines NYT Connections with innovative multi-level progression and strategic "red herring" mechanics.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Connections Plus** is a full-stack web application that transforms the classic word connection game into a multi-level experience with accumulating complexity. Built as a daily puzzle platform with comprehensive admin tools and player tracking.

### Key Innovation: The Red Herring Strategy

Unlike traditional Connections, this game introduces **red herring words** that carry forward across levels, creating layers of misdirection until they're revealed as their own "Double Meanings" group in the final level.

## üèó Technical Architecture

### Frontend Excellence

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for modern React development
- **TypeScript** throughout for type safety and developer experience
- **HeroUI** component library for polished, accessible UI components
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and transitions

### Backend & Data

- **Redis Cloud** for high-performance data storage and caching
- **Next.js API Routes** for serverless backend functionality
- **Claude AI API** integration for intelligent word generation
- **Basic Authentication** middleware for admin security

### Key Technical Features

- **Anonymous Player Tracking** using localStorage + cookies
- **Daily Puzzle System** with UTC midnight cutoffs
- **Real-time Progress Saving** to Redis
- **Responsive Grid System** handling 17-19 dynamic word layouts
- **Date-based Game Scheduling** with calendar interface

## üéÆ Game Design & Logic

### Multi-Level Progression System

```
Level 1: 17 words (16 regular + 1 red herring)
Level 2: 18 words (16 regular + 2 accumulated red herrings)
Level 3: 19 words (16 regular + 3 accumulated red herrings)
Level 4: 16 words (12 regular + 4 red herrings as final group)
```

### Strategic Complexity

- Red herrings from early levels might actually belong to groups in later levels
- Creates sophisticated misdirection and "aha!" moments
- Culminates in epic Level 4 reveal of the "Double Meanings" group

## üõ† Admin & Content Management

### Sophisticated Admin Panel

- **HeroUI DatePicker** for flexible puzzle scheduling
- **AI-Powered Word Generation** using Claude API
- **Red-Herring-First Workflow** ensuring strategic game design
